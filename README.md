### What is <img src=".gitbook/assets/emoji.png" alt="" data-size="line"> DKEY Bank?&#x20;

DKEY Bank is an ecosystem that empowers users to be in control of their finances by creating crypto-based passive income and harnessing the potentials of decentralized finance technologies. The ecosystem is optimized to deliver user-friendly controls and management of their assets and finances.

### What is the purpose of DKEY Bank? :thinking:&#x20;

DKEY Bank is fundamental to solve the problem that users faced in the crypto space. Currently, there is no clear guidance on the different type of cryptocurrency financing. The lack of knowledge can cause confusion and resistance. DKEY Bank’s ecosystem is a combination of popular crypto financing services that offer the user passive income that is informative with clear instructions.

### **Decentralized Finance** :globe\_with\_meridians:&#x20;

Decentralized Finance (De-Fi) is a **blockchain-based** financial institution that is not linked to any 3rd-party or intermediaries like banks and brokers. Decentralized Finance is among the most promising markets in blockchain technology. The demand for financial services on a decentralized technology is high. Because the nature of freely moving assets around captures the attention of many users. The optimistic expectations for the potential of this technology have been evident in the appreciating valuations of tokens native to DeFi protocols. The market value in the decentralized finance market has increased more than 50 times in the year 2020 and the current value is almost $60 Billion and increasing every day. After two years of conservative risk-taking, crypto investors have demonstrated that they’re willing to allocate capital to the most exciting use case of blockchain technology. Billions of people and institutions suffer from restricted or nonexistent access to financial services. But blockchain has extended beyond simply “banking the unbanked”. Therefore, different categories of services like DEX, Lending, NFT Games, Spot Exchange, Earn, Derivatives, AMM and much more financial products are developed and introduced to the market.&#x20;

### **Problems** :person\_gesturing\_no:&#x20;

Currently, almost every financial service available to the market is run by banks or brokerage. Ideally, the average user will put their hard-earned money in the bank for earning saving interest or opt for an investment product that is offered by the bank that yields almost nothing by the end of the terms, for the sake of growing their wealth. But that’s not all that simple, to make things even worse. There are hidden charges, transaction fees, the cross-border transaction is typically slow and expensive. All of this, because there are not many changes to the banking system for decades. Each transaction requires at least one or a few middlemen to complete. Since then fintech is trying hard to improve the banking system. However, banks are still hard-wired to existing intermediary banks. \


Then comes the new contender to the old banking system, which is Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance (De-Fi). The rise of decentralized technology gives new hopes and arguably the best alternative to the old banking system, which is now proven to change the future of the finance industry. However, decentralized finance services are still getting hiccups every now and then. Reliability is still a questionable problem faced by many of the users. The world of decentralization implies uncertainty at times, where the technology has yet to proven long term stability. As for now, users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and investment. But that about it, peer-to-peer lending and asset tokenization have yet to catch mainstream adoption. There is still a barrier between traditional assets and cryptocurrencies that needs to be solved. Imagine the endless possibility of what cryptocurrencies can do, if there was no barrier between the two worlds.

### Solutions :bulb:&#x20;

An extremely fragmented ecosystem is to be expected given that DeFi is currently in an early stage of development. As DeFi industries mature, super apps emerge that consolidate the leading services and provide a new level of user functionality. Super apps which have immersed itself into every layer of society, in the crypto finance industry such as Binance have been rapidly increasing in usage, popularity and liquidity. Binance is the largest crypto exchange in the world, with $500 million in daily trading volume as of early 2019, and allows users to make deposits, trading in crypto, and CFDs.

### The Decentralized App :jigsaw:&#x20;

DKEY Bank will be the first super app built on the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. To ensure our investor’s wealth is not compromised. DKEY Bank created a Token called “DKEY” a settlement token to create a tokenized ecosystem and rewarded it in DKEY Bank.\
DKEY Bank is designed for investors who want to grow their wealth and future proof their assets without going through all the obstacles for earning their returns. DKEY Bank will introduce core products that combine access to staking, swap, lending, and liquidity pools mining into one application and open both to traditional and crypto-asset holders. Whatever a user wants to execute in the DKEY Bank will be only a few clicks away. DKEY Bank ecosystem is developed around the notion of simplicity in providing the user with a great experience. The user interface will be designed to maximise navigational efficiency leading to a seamless user experience. To achieve this level of scale, DKEY Bank creates each financial service with security and effectiveness in mind.
